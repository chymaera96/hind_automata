# hind_automata
 A probabilistic automata framework for generating melodies in Hindustani classical raga. In addition, the generated automata can be used to produce melodies in particular ragas (or combination of ragas) using the GUI. It must be noted, however, that combining interpolating between the automata of multiple ragas produces more instances of disharmony.
